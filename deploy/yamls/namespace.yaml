# Create the OpenEBS namespace
# This is the default namespace where the Device driver will create all
# its resources. If we want to change it to use a different namespace
# modify this to create the new namespace and also modify the DEVICE_DRIVER_NAMESPACE
# env for the Device Driver's controller and agent deployments.
# please note that this should be changed while initial setup, once Device Driver
# is deployed with a namespace, we should never modify it as old resources will
# not be available under the new namespace and Device Driver looks for all the resources
# in the DEVICE_DRIVER_NAMESPACE namespace passed as an env.
